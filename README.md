# BigDataProject - Predicting Bitcoin price increase or decrease next minute in the long run

# Report

https://youtu.be/_PTs7POnvI0

# Result

Fail to predict, but we excluded some factor that may affect it. (I tend to believe it is random)

# Notes in short

Language used: Spark, Python, R

Source: Reddit database, and 1-minute price of bitcoin from 2015-10 to 2021-4

At first, we find data like prices or some big data indicator and make some transformation, then apply artifitial neural network to train. 

Lastly, apply confusion matrix to see how well the model fits.
